        A company has released a new internal system, and each employee has been
        assigned a username. Employees are allowed to change their usernames but
        only in a limited way. More specifically, they can choose letters at two
        different positions and swap them. For example, the username "bigfish"
        can be changed to "gibfish" (swapping 'b' and 'g') or "bighisf"
        (swapping 'f' and 'h'). The manager would like to know which employees
        can update their usernames so that the new username is smaller in
        alphabetical order than the original username.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        For each username given, return either "YES" or "NO" based on whether
        that username can be changed (with one swap) to a new one that is
        smaller in alphabetical order.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Note: For two different strings A and B of the same length, A is
          smaller than B in alphabetical order when on the first position where
          A and B differ, A has a smaller letter in alphabetical order than B
          has.</em

      <p>
        For example, let's say <em>usernames = ["bee", "superhero", "ace"]</em>.
        For the first username, "bee", it is not possible to make one swap to
        change it to a smaller one in alphabetical order, so the answer is "NO".
        For the second username, "superhero", it <em>is</em> possible get a new
        username that is smaller in alphabetical order (for example, by swapping
        letters 's' and 'h' to get "hupersero"), so the answer is "YES".
        Finally, for the last username "ace", it is not possible to make one
        swap to change it to a smaller one in alphabetical order, so the answer
        is "NO". Therefore you would return the array of strings ["NO", "YES",
        "NO"].

            There is just one username to consider in this case, and it is the
            username "hydra". One can swap, for example, the last two letters of
            it to get the new username "hydar". This is smaller in alphabetical
            order than "hydra", so the answer for this username is "YES"
            (without quotes).

            There are three usernames to consider in this case. For the first of
            them, "foo", it is not possible to make one swap to change it to a
            smaller one in alphabetical order, so the answer is "NO" (without
            quotes). For the second one, "bar", one can swap the letters "b" and
            "a" to get the new username "abr", which is smaller in alphabetical
            order, so the answer is "YES" (without quotes). Similarly, For the
            third username, "baz", one can swap the letters "b" and "ab" to get
            the new username "abz", which is smaller in alphabetical order, so
            the answer is "YES" (without quotes).
