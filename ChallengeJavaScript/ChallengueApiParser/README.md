# API Parser Challenge

Examine the pre-existing file structure and, given what's available, call the Star Wars API to load and display species data for _The Empire Strikes Back_.

## Instructions

- Review the associated [design](https://assets.livongo.com/image/upload/v1615306039/front-end-challenges/api-parser_uykt7z.png) carefully and match the data display exactly.
  - Height should be displayed in inches.
  - Images can be added from the `SPECIES_IMAGES` object.
- Only edit _App.js_, no changes to any other files (including Sass) are necessary.
- Due to an unfortunate issue with the API and CodeSandbox, you will have to alter the corresponding species URLs to be `https` rather than the default `http` or else they will not load correctly.
- Add the `Species` components inside of the `App-species` element.
- Keep a close eye on the PropTypes of `Species` and ensure there are no errors in the console.
